# ClipItToLSF
#### This extension allows you to go from a slow clip chimp loser to a fast ebic poggers clip champ!

## Step 1: Clip it

#### As soon as you press the publish button ClipItToLSF finds the url to your clip before it has finished processing and then opens a new submit tab to LSF with both url and title(same as clip title) already filled in.
